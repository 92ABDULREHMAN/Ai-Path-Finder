# Ai-Path-Finder
AI Pathfinder is a grid-based visualization tool that demonstrates uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, Bidirectional) to find a path from Start (S) to Target (T). It shows node exploration step-by-step and handles dynamic hurdles by re-planning paths, helping users understand search behavior in changing environments.
